<BaseLayout pageTitle={pageTitle}>
	<p>I guess I'm doing this again ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>
	<p>This site will likely (slowly) evolve over time, when/if I have time to work on it and things I'd like to add or
		change. Generally, you can expect some <a href="/writings">writings</a> -- mostly in blog form but maybe a
		poem/vignette or stream of
		consciousness or listicle, as the mood strikes me. There may also be an image thrown in here or there. I'm not
		sure I'll ever add a comment/contact capability, if you really feel a need to talk to me you probably already
		have my contact info anyway.</p>

	<p>There is also a very non-zero chance that the site will get randomly abandoned for weeks or months at a time. I
		might forget about it or give up on it entirely -- history repeats itself, after all. But, I'll keep it around
		for
		as long as I feel I'm getting
		something out of posting to & maintaining it.</p>

	<p>One random thing I liked about building this was making my h1s look like WordArt. I did this with CSS, lifted
		almost directly from <a target="_blank" href="https://maciekpalmowski.dev/">this blog</a> which is styled way
		better than I will ever have the patience or vision to manage on my own pages.</p>
	<p>Anyway, if you (like me) miss the joys of making WordArt, <a target="_blank"
			href="https://www.makewordart.com/">I got
			you.</a></p>
