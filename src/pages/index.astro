	<p>I guess i'm doing this again 🤷🏻‍♀️</p>
	<p>My h1s look like WordArt, but I actually did this with CSS, lifted almost directly from <a target="_blank" href="https://maciekpalmowski.dev/">this blog</a> which is styled way better than I will ever have the patience to manage on my own page.</p>
	<p>However, if you (like me) miss WordArt, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.makewordart.com/">I got you.</a></p>
