Sometimes I get really really really into things and spend a disproportionate amount of time thinking about/doing/searching for/eating/drinking/playing/listening to them. Here are the things I'm fixated on right now.

### üßÄ Cottage cheese 

Specifically, the Z√ºger brand organic cottage cheese[^1]. I love it so much that I have eaten a tub of it almost every day for weeks. It's not that cottage cheese in and of itself is all that special, though it has a decent amount of protein, which is nice. There's just something about the mildly salty/sour/cheesy taste, combined with the texture of little soft lumps, that is really hitting all the right notes for me right now. I've actually been eating it so much recently that I've unintentionally persuaded folks from my lunch groups to have it as well. Am I a micro-influencer now?

### ü©¥ Fake Birkenstocks

I mean, the shoes themselves aren't fake, and I don't actually know if Birkenstock was the _first_ brand to have this type of shoe bed that molds to your feet over time, but it's the term most people will understand best for a type of shoe I otherwise would not know how to properly describe. I had a pair of fake Birks from Kohl's back when I lived in the States that I wore for YEARS until I finally wore them out, and they were the most comfortable shoes ever. I've had my eye out for a specific style of Birks for quite a while (again, fake ones only, because $), and I finally found a brand that has the right style, goes up to my size for women's shoes (not always a given when you're a US11/EU42), and had a color I liked. I got myself [a pair](https://paladoshoes.com/collections/palado-cres/products/cres-flieder-matt?variant=46675033784663) and they are every bit as comfy as I've dreamed. 10/10 would buy again.

### üé≤ Not Another D&D Podcast

I've [already written](/posts/as-yet-untitled) about how much I enjoy the world of actual-play tabletop RPGs as entertainment, so I guess it's pretty on-brand for me to have found yet another source to be obsessed with. It features some of the players from Dimension 20 that I already knew and loved, as well as two folks who were previously unknown to me but who are also great at creating fun and funny moments in the context of an adventure. Plus, one of the characters has a deep Southern accent and a pet possum that gets into trouble and makes weird noises! Of course I got hooked!

### üçæ Berliner Luft

This is an alcohol that most people agree (some fondly, others less so) has a taste reminiscent of mouthwash. I land on the side of: it doesn't burn like mouthwash, and it is a little mintier and sweeter, and therefore it is amazing and ooh boy I love it. I have earned myself a bit of a reputation for not only bringing it to events, but for encouraging others to imbibe with me. People laugh, but they also keep saying yes when I ask if they want to do shots, so who am I to not give the people what they want? 

I actually also recently made a custom emoji in our workspace Slack for Berliner Luft. I feel I have solidified my legacy.

### üéÄ‚òïÔ∏è Barbenheimer memes[^2]

I recall first seeing a juxtaposition of the Barbie and Oppenheimer films in a "you're either one or the other" context and being annoyed, because it seemed coded as "you're either a dumb bimbo or a serious person". Other people seemed to agree, and since then there has been a flood of tweets & memes celebrating the ability of people to contain multitudes and be both, and more. I dig that. I will be seeing both movies and I will be dressing in pink for Barbie and having a martini for Oppenheimer. (Won't smoke any cigarettes, though.)
