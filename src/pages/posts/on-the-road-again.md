(Does anyone else always sing the words "on the road again" [like Donkey from Shrek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Myb-eAt_RxY) every single time? No? Just me? Ok.)

## Off to Prague

......

## Actually, pit stop at Shrek

Ok, when I started typing I thought I was going to write about what I was doing (traveling to Prague), but then I started thinking about the movie Shrek, and I just... it's such a good movie. It is unironically my favorite movie. The soundtrack is absolutely god-tier, it's anti conventional beauty standards and pro self-sufficient women, it's delightfully raunchy and more than a bit unhinged, there's a Scottish accent, what's not to love? 

It also propelled the fame of the song "All Star" by Smash Mouth, and one of my favorite [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eT3BFzSD6YY) that will always make me laugh is the pitch-corrected version where the lyrics get to "and they don't stop comin'" and then simply repeaet this phrase in place of every other phrase for the rest of the song. I don't know what it is about this that so tickles my funny bone, but damn, I love this. On multiple watch occasions, I've laughed so hard I cried[^1]. Good stuff. 

## Ok, back to other stuff

I'm on the road to Prague with some friends for a long weekend of eating and drinking and eating and drinking and then some more eating and drinking. One of our friends is a local and not only will we get all of his good recommendations, we're also going to meet his parents, who seem like absolutely the coolest people to drink with. Can't wait.

This week has been a little rough otherwise, so I'm pretty happy to have a little getaway to take my mind off things. I also got some good news at work, which is that the colleague I've worked with on my team just about the longest is finally coming to Berlin! He has come to Berlin before, but only when I wasn't in town, which made me so sad. I'm excited to finally hang out with him for real, and to buy him all the beers I owe him for years of answering my stupidest questions.

One other thing to look forward to is a quick trip to London in two weeks. I haven't been to the UK since January of 2013, when I went to England and Wales with my college choir. I have fond memories of that trip and of London, but I was only there shortly and it was also 10 years ago (?!) so I'm excited to see what impression I have of it this time around. I'm also going with someone who lived there (albeit briefly) so again, getting the local experience.

After that, hopefully I'll stick around Berlin mostly. Summer in Berlin is magic. âœ¨

[^1]: I can pinpoint the day I found this video, because I sent it to all my work friends on slack to annoy them -- mostly Max, because he's the one that gets songs stuck in his head the worst. February 27, 2020. Pre-pandemic! It was a great day.
