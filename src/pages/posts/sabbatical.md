I decided this morning I'd put (proverbial) pen to paper and write up a little on how my sabbatical has been going. We've been in the States since September 20th, not working. It has been almost a full month, and we have a bit of time left still, for which I am thankful -- I'm enjoying this immensely. We've spent time with family and friends, and have taken a road trip to see some new places and spend time in nature. I could say a truly uncountable number of words about all of it, but they say a picture's worth a thousand words, so... 

## Step 1: Figure out how to share more than one image in a blog post here

I _should_ probably add the MDX integration to this project, because I am sure it would be nice to have this flexibility, but frankly I can't be bothered right now. So for now, I'm just going to go the [easy route](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/#images-in-markdown-files).

## Step 2: Actually choose the pictures

Because I have like......a LOT of pictures. So many. I'm not going to dump them all here, but I want to give a bit of a feel for the variety of what we've gotten to do.

## Step 3: Shut up and add them already

Ok ok ok. I'm on it. Most of these will be from the road trip, but trust me when I say we've been doing really fun stuff everywhere and I'll write more about it some other time.

Devil's Thumb

Beehive Geyser, which goes off only once during the daytime park opening hours and which shoots water higher than Old Faithful

Beehive Geyser and me; the geyser erupts for several minutes at a time, so you can snap quite a few photos while it's going off!

Just so many geysers, so many hot springs, so many strange and beautiful landscapes

## Grand Teton National Park

Near the shore of Jenny Lake, which we intended to hike around
![Snow-capped mountains reflecting into calm water](/IMG_6986.jpeg)

I couldn't get a good picture of them, but there are 2 moose in this picture, which really wanted to stay on the trail and ultimately prevented us from hiking around the lake entirely; we turned around and went back the way we came

## Custer State Park and Badlands National Park

Have you noticed yet that I really like rock formations reflected in calm waters?

There were tunnels to walk and to drive through in the rocks on the Needles Highway

This time it's trees and water, from a hike around Center Lake

The layered and eroding formations of the Badlands are hard to describe or capture
