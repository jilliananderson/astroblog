Another day, another blog post. Or should I say, another year? Or two? 

Aside from not really knowing what kind of content to create or share, I also grapple with the typical web developer problem of always wanting to rebuild or refactor my personal site and never finding a stopping point where I feel it's good enough to be released into the world. It would probably behoove me to make an actual design first sometime, instead of just rebuilding it and hoping that inspiration will strike and I'll suddenly know how to make it look beautiful and fun and cool. You know, that skill that actual designers spend years learning and honing? Yeah. I really shouldn't hold my breath here. 

But content-wise, I find myself inspired by my friends Clara and Robin, who write beautifully about the various happenings of their lives rather than centering their pages around one specific topic or niche. 

So, since today I feel like writing about what I've been up to lately, I'll do that!

Lately, I've been turning to, of all things, Neopets when I am looking for a mindless game to play when I need a break from focusing on work. Specifically, a game called Destruct-o-match, which (in Classic mode) is a simple block-matching game that gets progressively more challenging. My other anxiety-reducing game is slightly less mindless, but a bit silly nonetheless; Wordscapes, a game in which you are given 5-7 letters and must make as many words as possible, including several specific words in a crossword-esque format. 

In terms of content I'm consuming, I have been slowly watching my way through the many seasons of the TTRPG actual-play show, Dimension 20. My introduction to this was with their Fantasy High seasons, in which the players are high school students learning to be adventurers, which leads to a lot of hilarity and of course, cool fights and magic shenanigans. Most recently I've been watching The Unsleeping City, in which the players are residents of a New York City which has a magical side that is hidden from the vast majority of its residents. The New York/New Jersey accents, the embracing of the city's filthy rats and cockroaches, and the ever-shifting constellations of the characters' relationships to each other and to non-player characters (NPCs) have drawn me in and kept me on the edge of my seat. Generally speaking, there's just something very special about the type of group storytelling that is facilitated by game systems like D&D that you don't find in other media. I feel more emotionally involved than I do with most TV shows or films; I also find them funnier and less predictable.

As I'm writing this paragraph, I'm in a region of France called Ardeche, visiting Robin and Clara. This is the second time we've been here, and it's a joy to return to this beautiful place, to buy produce and bread and cheese from the local markets, to smell all the flowers in the garden and eat fresh salads grown by our friends. We've also been lucky enough to get to go climbing on some of the absolutely gorgeous rock in the area. It was a great refresher on lead climbing, as well as a lovely reintroduction to climbing after taking more than a month off while waiting for my dislocated finger to heal. Not to mention it's just a really pleasant way to spend some time outdoors with friends!
