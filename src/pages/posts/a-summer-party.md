## A Summer Party

Beautiful, unforgiving sun, sparkling over soft waves.

Chatter and laughter of greetings and meetings rolling across the beach.

Fake tattoos and flower crowns and floating unicorns in technicolor.

Glowing faces radiating enthusiasm, intensity, earnestness.

Forgotten droplets of melted ice cream. Sticky bare feet.

Glitter of unknown origin, shared as shoulders brush.

Swirling ice in sweating glasses.

Blurry reflections in glossy photobooth prints. Captured chaos.

Joyful exuberance, a pulsing rhythm, communing with the beat and maybe each other.

Picnic table confessions at midnight.

The tender embraces of sweet summer.
